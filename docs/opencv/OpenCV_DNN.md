# OpenCV DNN
## Overview of DNN Module
* DNN (Deep Neural Network) module was initially part of opencv_contrib repo. 
* It has been moved to the master branch of opencv repo last year, giving users the ability to run inference on pre-trained deep learning models within OpenCV itself.
* One thing to note here is, **dnn module** is not meant be used for training. **Itâ€™s just for running inference on images/videos**.
* Initially only Caffe and Torch models were supported. Over the period support for different frameworks/libraries like TensorFlow is being added.
* **Support for YOLO/DarkNet has been added recently**

## Detection from the Image
```
detect_image.py
```
* Load model and related parameters: get_model_labels_and_output_layers.py
* Object_detection.py
  * get_detection_results.py
  * detect_object
```
    convert_image_to_blob(frame)

    confidences, boxes, centroids = get_detection_details(frame,
                                                          each_layer_output,
                                                          minimum_confidence_score,
                                                          object_index)
                                                          
    indexes = apply_non_maxima_suppression(boxes, confidences, minimum_confidence_score, nms_threshold_value)
```
* detect_violations.py
```
    if len(results) >= 2:
        # Step 1: Distance Calculation based on Centroids
        # i. Create an Array of Centroids
        centroids = np.array([r[2] for r in results])

        # ii. Compute the Euclidean distances between "All pairs" of the centroids
        distance_between_observations = dist.cdist(centroids, centroids, metric="euclidean")

        # Step 2: Compare calculated distance with the Minimum distance to be flagged as Violation
        for i in range(0, distance_between_observations.shape[0]):
            for j in range(i + 1, distance_between_observations.shape[1]):

                # Step 3: Is Distance between any two centroid pairs is less than the configured "Number of pixels"
                if distance_between_observations[i, j] < minimum_distance:

                    # Step 4: Mark the observations/persons as Violations
                    set_of_violations.add(i)
                    set_of_violations.add(j)

    return set_of_violations

 ## Detection from the Video
```
detect_video.py
```
Same as above process, except that we process for each frame
```
    # video_stream = cv2.VideoCapture(-1)
    video_stream = cv2.VideoCapture("inputs/pedestrians.mp4")
    while True:
        # Read the next frame from the file
        (grabbed, frame) = video_stream.read()
        # End of the stream: when frame is not grabbed then we have reached the end of stream
        if not grabbed:
            break

        frame = imutils.resize(frame, width=700)
        detection_results = get_detection_results(frame,
                                                  model,
                                                  layer_numbers,
                                                  person_index
                                                  )
        # print(detection_results)
        # (0.998525857925415, (377, 179, 557, 736), (467, 458))
        # Confidence Score, Bounding Box coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2), Centroid
        violations = detect_violations(detection_results)
        # print(violations)
        output_frame = draw_detections_and_violations(frame, detection_results, violations)
        write_and_save_video(output_frame)
```

### Advantages of Tensorflow over OpenCV DNN
* OpenCV offers **GPU module**
* You will be the one to pick which classes and methods to use so at least **some knowledge about GPU programming** will be helpful. 
* In Tensorflow, you can **easily** use the GPU implementation by setting the number of GPUs you have or if you want to use both

## Conclusion
* Object detected using **only OpenCV** is not optimal and using TensorFlow as a framework gives you more options to explore like networks, algorithms. 
* TensorFlow is optimal at **training** part i.e. at data handling(tensors) and OpenCV is optimal in **accessing and manipulating** data (resize, crop, webcams etc.,). 
* Thus, both are used together for object detection
